    "text": "Hello again, I'm Andrej. I attended the Secondary School of Electro-Computing in Maribor, where I first encountered programming, namely C++. Throughout high school I hadn't developed much interest in programming, it came when I started attending University of Maribor, The Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and started creating projects in my spare time. I am also a very big fan of various sports, especially football, which I trained for 13 years and currently play in the university team.",
